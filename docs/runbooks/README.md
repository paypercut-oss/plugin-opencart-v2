# Runbooks

Operational procedures for the PayPerCut OpenCart v2 payment module. Each runbook
is a short, skimmable, command-first document for a single scenario.

> These docs are for maintainers and on-call. They are **not** shipped to
> merchants — the release workflow excludes `docs/` from the `.ocmod.zip`.

## Conventions

- **One scenario per file.** If a procedure branches into two distinct workflows,
  split it.
- **Commands over prose.** Prefer exact shell commands, UI paths, and expected
  outputs over explanations.
- **Every runbook has a Verification and a Rollback section.** If rollback is
  not possible, say so explicitly.
- **Date-stamp verification.** Update `Last verified` whenever the procedure is
  executed or reviewed. Runbooks older than 90 days should be re-verified.

## Adding a runbook

1. Copy [`_template.md`](_template.md) to a new file with a kebab-case name
   describing the scenario (`fix-<thing>.md`, `rotate-<thing>.md`, etc.).
2. Fill in every section. Remove sections that genuinely do not apply and
   replace with `_Not applicable_`.
3. Add a row to the index table above.
4. Open a PR labeled `runbook`. Request review from a maintainer who has
   executed the procedure at least once.
